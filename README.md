**unit_converter**
I have used the tkinter and pint to get the different units to convert the given input figures. 
The pint module in Python is a library for handling physical quantities and units of measurement. 
It provides a simple and consistent interface for working with units and performing unit conversions. 
The primary goal of the pint library is to make it easy to work with physical quantities in a way that is both intuitive and flexible.

**currency_converter**
I've used the tinker and the forex-python module for creating this currency converter.
The forex-python is a Python library that provides a simple interface for fetching exchange rates and performing currency conversions. 
It allows users to access exchange rate data from various sources, facilitating the development of applications that involve currency conversion.
